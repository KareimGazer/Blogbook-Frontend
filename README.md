# BlogBook

## Future Roadmap

### Blogs

- add date created
- make a didicated page for each blog
- the ability to bookmark a blog "book marked property in the user document"
- filter by topic
- follow/mute author
- topics interested in for feed
- follow other topics
- reading history (good for recommendations)

``` md
|- /main
|  |- index.js
|  |- index.unit.test.js
|- /supporting
|  |- fetch.js
|- /tests
|  |- /int
|  |  |- api.int.test.js
```

## Testing
- mocking getting blogs data in the app or the dedicated component to be written
- integration tests like seeing the notification when a new blog is created
